# Conway's Game of Life

This is a realization of the [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life). The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.


## My motivation

My motivation is *to practice with programming* and, especially, with *game development*. I have interests in different technical details and realizations of the game. E.g. switching between canvas and HTML's table when the script is already running.

So I created the repo to try to realize the game by my own. I don't think you'll be interested in contributing to it.
